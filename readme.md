# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Each year is organized into its own folder, with the corresponding problems and solutions.

## Structure

- `year/`: Folder for each year (e.g., `2024/`).
    - `day1/main.go`, `day2/main.go`, ...: Solutions for each day.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code-solutions.git

2. Navigate to the appropriate year's folder:
   ```bash
   cd 2024/day1
   ```
3. Run a solution (e.g., Day 1 in Go):
